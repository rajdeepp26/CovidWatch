# CovidWatch
CovidWatch- A system to access factual information & updates with features to solve the issues of the citizens.
Contributors- I and Ashish Kumar Yadav[@dev_aky].
Our contribution towards solving the issues and challenges India is facing during this global pandemic of COVID 19. We have designed an application which can be used to solve the issues which are being faced on a daily basis by the citizens when the country is in complete lockdown.

## The key issues our portal is solving
1. Providing factual, realtime and validated information related to COVID 19.
2. Receiving information of the available services near the user's location like nearby functional stores.
3. Functionality of posting a query/ issues by userâ€™s of a particular locality which can be seen by other members of the locality and can be solved by administration.
4. We have also used Apollo Risk Scan Chatbot which can assist users to perform self assessment and risk analysis of getting infected by the corona virus and help the user to decide whether to do a COVID 19 test.
